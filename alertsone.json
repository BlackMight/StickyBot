  "UPDATES": "Hello Everyone, this is Sticky Jorden from The Bot Maintenance Team with some updates that have occurred. From now on, the command !pick will have the user, time, and the bot's selection documented. Depending on how much space documentation takes up, as well as your feedback, will determine if this documentation carries over to other commands like Echo and Holiday. If you want to see the total list of recorded commands you may use !doc command to do so. User Accounts are now available!! If you would like to see your current Level and Skill open your Skyrim I mean Republic skill tree using the command !level to view it!! Everyone will be placed at Level 1 and Skill 0 at this current moment until further updates. There is a command !inc to add or increase skill to only the user who used the command. This command is only for ADMINS right not but in future updates will be limited to the Supreme Leader however the Supreme Leader will not be the only way to increase skill in future updates. I left a lot of things unsaid but the are the major points if you want a more detailed update I would be more than willing to do so. Please DM me feedback the team would certainly appreciate it. If you needed to see the updates once again at any time use the command !updates.  Sorry this is a lot of text, but the team did a lot of work to update this bot so please enjoy it!! This is Sticky Jorden from The Bot Maintenance Team signing off 😊"
